# process_terminator
Effectively enumerates all active processes on one's Windows OS and lists by PID, service name, CPU usage, and memory usage in descending memory usage order and prompts for process termination. Program loops after every process termination until user prompts "N" or "n." Personally believe this route is more effective than the current windows task manager. Make sure to research each process effectively before terminating it as it may be necessary for OS functionality. Otherwise terminate any unwanted processes that you please and carefully do so by analyzing its memory and CPU usage.
